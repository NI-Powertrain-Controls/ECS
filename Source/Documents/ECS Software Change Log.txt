Version ECS_2015.0.3
2/24/2015

Notes:
Fixed bug in Control - Direct Injection.vi which prevented FOR loop from running
Changed Calpoints in Hardware Out - 9759-1 (Throttle).vi to read from Cal File calibration
Changed DI Pulse Check.vi to only indicate a pulse overlap if relevant channels are enabled
Changed SparkAdv_Man Calpoint in Control - Spark.vi to an array instead of scalar (individual cylinder manual advance)
Overhaul of Host VI plot look and feel
Added a disable button for the XNET VI to prevent unnecessary faults
Moved several calpoints outside of conditional disables in Hardware In - ECS - EPTx Interface.vi
Removed cvi_lvrt.dll from project directory (no longer needed for LabVIEW 2015)
