	"Convention for CalPoint names:  Meaningful descriptions to someone not familiar with the code are written in CamelCase; that is, only the first letter of a word is capitalized with no spaces in between words. Acronyms have all characters capitalized but abbreviations do not, e.g., Adv for Advance and CAC for Charge Air Cooler.  The description is followed by an underscore and variable modifier; if two modifiers are required, they are written in CamelCase in the most meaningful order.  RT variable names must convey the same language but may be expanded and written with spaces with units written in brackets and qualifiers in parentheses, e.g., [kPa], (optional), etc.  In the case where two capitals are adjacent but part of different words or acronyms, no spaces, underscores, or hyphens are used."
	"Calpoint Examples:  RailP_Tbl, RailP_TblOut, IMEP_Des, SparkAdv_ManE, FQVDurAngle_PIDMax"
	"Note: If a modifier isn't needed, it is not required.  Examples of this are: A) a primary output/value, B) a sensor-read value, or C) only mentioned once"
	Note: FaultPoints have no modifiers but follow the same variable convention
